    "A large data set might have one million images. A small data could have two-thousand images. The dividing line between a large data set and small data set is somewhat subjective. Overfitting is a concern when using transfer learning with a small data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Images of dogs and images of wolves would be considered similar; the images would share common characteristics. A data set of flower images would be different from a data set of dog images. \n",

    "## Demonstration Network\n",
    "To explain how each situation works, we will start with a generic pre-trained convolutional neural network and explain how to adjust the network for each case. Our example network contains three convolutional layers and three fully connected layers:\n",
