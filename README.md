# Deep_Learning
This repository explains concepts in various Artificial Neural Networks using Deep Learning frameworks such as MLP, CNN, RNN, etc through implementation in Tensorflow using Keras in the form of projects.
- Read my Medium post, published in Analytics Vidhya's Medium handle, about steps involved in building an MLP Neural Network [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-an-mlp-neural-network-53f946c1d804).
